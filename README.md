# SheetGit - A Version Control System for Spreadsheets

SheetGit is an add-in for Excel that allows every user to keep their spreadsheets under version control. 
It is engineered to be used by those without any experience in the matter, 
bringing the benefits that programmers long have enjoyed to the hands of end users.

## Features
The tool is still under development but we intend to have several Git features properly implemented, such as:

- Viewing commits through a tree graph.
- Saving and restoring commits.
- Display differences between versions.
- Automatic commits.
- Creating commit messages and tags.
- Allow collaboration of multiple users on a spreadsheet repository.
